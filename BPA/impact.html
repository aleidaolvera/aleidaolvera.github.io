                    <h2><b>Artists Impact</b></h2>
                    Music is an artistic expression of identity; it is the declaration of the ideas, traditions, and emotions of individuals and of people. Artists use music to express their joy or sorrow, their hopes and aspirations, or simply their place in society or their culture. However, this artistic expression can often conflict with the opinions of those in power, who might judge the music of a particular artist to run contrary to popular ideas or practices. In this case, the person in power can choose to censor the works of an artist, whether it be through traditional legal methods (regulatory censorship) or through forcing them out of the market through competing products (market-censorship). In this way censorship harms the artist economically, as the artist is unable to make a living out of their chosen profession. Moreover, the censor also infringes on the artist’s right to share their music professionally, something that can be seen as vital to their career. The artist wishes to share their creation, their talent, their passion with the public, and the censor tramples on the artist by prohibiting their art from the public square, or even censoring pieces of the work.

                    <h2><b>Society</b></h2>
                    Music has been a part of human society for almost all of history, with crude musical instruments being discovered and dated back almost 20,000 years. It can reflect the feelings and emotions of a whole generation and be a powerful emotional force. And, on a less profound note, music is something that gives people pleasure; who hasn’t moved along to one of their favorite songs, or sang along to the lyrics? Censorship of such an integral part of human culture is always a bad thing, despite any misguided valourous intent. Noted Irish playwright and critic George Bernard Shaw called censorship an “inherently conservative action”, as it seeks to perserve tradition. Indeed, censors often use the example of controversial lyrics or new advancements in music, such as rock n’ roll or rap music, to take the blame for society’s faults. Sometimes attacks on music were even racially  motivated, such as petitions targeting “Negro records” in the 50s. However, what censors often ignore is that music is often a reflection of the artist’s reality; the obscene lyrics of rap often said to glorify sex and violence is actually documentation of real events, of the culture that pervades the artist’s situation. Music shows a way that musicians can show the world their situation, as if to say “Hey everyone! Where I’m from, men often inflict senseless violence on one another and glorify the sexual objectification of women!” This is a way that artists can open a dialogue on societal issues, as a way for them and others to cope with reality.
