                        The Censorship of music is not as recent as people think, in fact  it actually began in the early 20th century when the United States Congress passed the Radio Act of 1927. This act prohibited the use of obscene, explicit and profane language via radio and was used as a way for the government to control the content being broadcast. This act would be later used in the 1970’s in order to fine a radio station for the usage of the word sex on air.

                        In the year 1934, the Federal Communications Comission was created by Congress in order to monitor international communications via radio, television satellite, and cable across all 50 states.
                        Since its formation and to the present day the agency has been in control of the music play by:

                        As a result of the direct involvement of the FCC, people during the 1940’s and 50’s began to question the agency and their music censoring. Under the FCC, several artists have been victims of music censoring.
                        <br>
                        A band known as The Weavers lost their recording contract thus ending their career after the FCC blacklisted them for their leftist political beliefs.  In 1957, Elvis Presley on his very own show, “The Ed Sullivan Show” was a victim of censoring because the FCC considered his dancing inappropriate and as  a result Presley was only recorded from the waist up.

                        It wasn’t until the 60’s and 70’s that the censoring of music became more prominent. As artists began to gain a laid-back attitude, the usage of drugs and sexual activity increased. Thus, resulting in censorship in order to prevent the public from being exposed to obscenity. Artists such as the Doors and Jim Morrison were jailed for indecent exposure and indecency. The Beatles’ Yesterday and Today album, showcasing a controversial cover, led to public outrage; the album was recalled and then re-released with new a cover art. 
                        <br>
                        Another band known as The Kingsmen underwent a two-year investigation by the FBI over their song “Louie Louie” due to the mumbled chorus being suspected of being indecent, however unable to tell the lyrics apart they are not considered obscenity. Following this several more artists were victim of music censorship, including: The Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix, and Bob Dylan.

                        Heavily censoring continued as the BBC, began to ban plenty of songs from being broadcasted, as well as the FCC who soon began to send warnings to any potential broadcasts of vulgar music.
                        <br>
                        The rest of the era’s were defined by even more music censoring, as in 1978 the Supreme Court ruled that the Federal Communications Commision had the right to restrict indecency. 
                        <br>
                        In 1985, the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) pushed to create what is known as a the Parental Advisory Label,  which is used to rate audio recordings based on the amount material unsuitable for young audiences, and the label must be placed on such recordings. The Parental Advisory Label is still seen today, but many begin to question what is the purpose of placing such a label.
