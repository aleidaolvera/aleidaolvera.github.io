          <h3><em>Creed</em></h3>
		    	<p class="para" style="padding-top:.07%;">I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live. I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.</p>
            <!--<h3><em>History</em></h3>
		    	<p class="para" style="padding-top:.07%;">The Technology Student Association (TSA), formerly AIASA, is the oldest student organization dedicated exclusively to students enrolled in technology education classes grades K-12. It has a rich history that spans nearly four decades. Three distinct periods may be found in TSA's history. During the period from 1958 to 1978, the American Industrial Arts Student Association (AIASA) was a sponsored activity of the American Industrial Arts Association (AIAA). In 1978, the nonprofit corporation, AIASA, Inc., was formed to oversee AIASA as a separate organization. During the decade that followed, the organization grew in size, strength, structure, and impact on students and secondary school programs. The summer of 1988 closed this third decade as AIASA reached another milestone, a change in the organization's name: the Technology Student Association (TSA).</p>-->

            <p class="para">
                Our chapter President is Jose Luis Elizondo. Jose is a senior and also our Texas TSA State President. He worked hard at the start of high school to become President of Texas TSA and wants to make it known to all members of TSA that it is not impossible to become a state officer. "It takes hard work, dedication, and passion for Texas TSA, which is something that each member of our TSA chapter has," says Jose. Along with this, he is an active member of Veterans' NHS chapter, where he acts as the organization's President. While being swamped with the stress of college applications and scholarships, he still maintains his top 10% ranking in his class and makes time to show each member of our chapter that he values their dedication and participation in TSA.

               Our chapter Vice-President is Aleida Olvera. Aleida Olvera is a junior and had the pleasure of working alongside Jose and the rest of the officer team by being apart of the Texas TSA State Leadership Team. This position allowed her to shadow the officers and find out how being an officer works. Along with this Aleida is a member of Veterans' BPA chapter, apart of our school's Student Council as the Book Club representative, and an active member of NHS. Just recently she became a National Center for Women - Aspirations in Computing National Award Recipient and will be receiving a laptop, $500, as well as a trip to North Carolina for the national awards summary. With all this, she still maintains an excellent academic record and is in the top 5% of her class.

He is currently working on an innovative project to help protect others from dangerous situations with the use of a bluetooth connected wristband. His favorite part of TSA is the competitive season, where he strives daily to do better than he did in his previous years. Having participated in Video Game Design has inspired him to want to pursue a career in a computational field in the future.<br>

His favorite competitive events to participate in are Music Production and Debating Technological Issues. Being an active leader within his school by assuming leadership roles in Veterans’ Student Council, NHS, and TSA chapters has only inspired him to pursue a career in the field of politics. Along with his involvement in other extracurricular activities, Gilbert is ranked number 10 in his class and even ran for Texas TSA state office this past year. His success in his academics and leadership abilities are a result of TSA’s influence in his life and  is forever grateful for this organization.<br>
