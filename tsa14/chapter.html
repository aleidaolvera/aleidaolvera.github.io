   <h2>"Learning to Live in a Technical World"</h2>
	<p>   <img src="images/longhorn.jpg" />
    I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry.
    <br />Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.
	<br />I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living.
	<br />I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability.
	<br />I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.
