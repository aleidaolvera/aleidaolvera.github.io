				<h2><center><em>Rise of Colonias:</em></center> <br>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</h2>
				<p>FThe US Dept of Housing and Urban Development created the <a class="link" href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/101st-congress/senate-bill/566/text">Crantston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990</a> that reserved portions of Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) money to go toward Colonias. This act can be credited with beginning the pattern of giving money to fix the current condition of Colonias. It's primary purpose was to help improve infrastructure of Colonia homes by setting aside <b>money</b> to improve water and sewer systems as well as sanitary housing. This program called for 10% of the Community Development Block Grant to be put aside for the improvement of Colonia communities.</p>

					This money was allocated from the Community Development Block Grant and focused on the implimentation of water and sewer systems. Colonias have this money set aside for them, but many times this spending takes years to put into play. Such is the case with the CDBG, although large sums of money has been set aside, the money is not being put to use by what it is designated for.

				<h2>Status of Colonias: Rio Grande Valley</h2>
				<p>
					Nearly 70% of the people living in colonias are concentrated in the Rio Grande Valley region. This area is riddled with poverty, but there only way to draw attention to their area is to go through a census. This way lawmakers can use this data to factor in the amount of people living in these conditions in order to continue to work towards a better solution.

				<h2>Spending on Colonias to Increase</h2>
				<p>
					Living conditions in Colonias worsen to the point that <a class="link" href="http://www.fronterasdesk.org/content/10004/health-risks-living-us-border-colonias-prompt-funding-increase-proposal">Obama Administration</a> urges for a 50% increase in spending to alleviate the health-risk conditions the residents face. At this point there are 2,500 Colonia communities throughout the US-Mexico border -- with a majority being from small Texas counties. At this point, the Colonia Initiatives Program says 38,000 Texans on the border have no running water. Buyers were promised water line installations in their nearby homes that were never created. 
					<br><br>
					With the Obama administration having to bring attention to legislators, it is clear that Colonias -- although frequently spoken of -- is not as pressing an issue as Texas' budget says it is.  With plenty of money to help alleviate these issues, residents continue to wonder why promises are not being met.

			Forty years after the rise of Colonias the HUD used their power to bring awareness to the different Colonias in various states. This institution became one of the first to put aside government money in order to attempt to fix the living conditions of those who live in Colonias.

				The image above shows the direct language used in the Act. The act also helped spur other agencies to set aside money from various programs in order to help improve Colonias.

				While the installation of this act seemed promising, many saw that HUD was working to rid Colonias instead of fix them. Any counties hoping to take advantage of this must fall under Model Subdivision Rules created by the government. The rules only allow for a certain condition to be given funding, which many counties do not meet. Scholars have noted that the allocation of money does nothing to help the community, and instead the HUD should focus on more actively directing the money to non-profits who will help improve the infrastructure of the colonias without imposing the <a class="link" href="http://aarriaga3.wixsite.com/proyectoazteca/model-subdivisions">Model Subdivision Rules.</a>

			<p>
			After the resulting failure in the government's ability to humanize the situation of Colonia residents lawmakers created this team. There most notable project is the creation of a "Colonia database," in 2005. This database houses information of the current condition of Colonia counties.

				The image above shows the direct language used in the bill. The Secretary of State had the option of keeping the team small, but because of the dire problem Colonias pose a team was formed.

					<h1>"The Colonia Initiatives Program asked the Legislature to address the definition and declassification issues in... reports to the Legislature, but no action has been taken, and several lawmakers... were unaware of the program’s requests. - <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2015/03/03/state-waiting-legislature-directions-declassify-co/">The Texas Tribune</a></h1>
				</center>

				<hr class="light">
			<p class="content">
				The database is meant to continually be updated as progress is made to different communities, but the Colonia Initiatives Program has no ability to declassify Colonias or update information to reflect the existing conditions of these communities. Progress cannot be tracked, which is an important component when trying to improve a community. This only adds to the pattern of legislation that creates opportunity, but does not take advantage of the opportunity to continue to improve living conditions. Senator Jose Rodriguez questioned why legislation was needed to adress this issue, for this is a simple task. He cites this issue to Texas attitude saying, "...you know how we are in Texas — we like to make things complicated and proper."

If Texas legislators only focused on passing laws the same way they did with this one, the Colonia residents would not have to worry if they will ever get water, electricity, or a proper sewage system.
