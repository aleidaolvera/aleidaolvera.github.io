					<hr>
					<p>On campus, I am a Student Communications and Technology Assistant for Georgetown's Biomedical Graduate Education, a Code as a Second Language Fellow with the Hispanic Heritage Foundation, Microsoft Student Partner, and Georgetown Community Scholar. I am hoping to partner with a company during the Summer of 2018 that will allow me to continue to explore my passion for computing.</p>

					<p>
						In the past, I have held office as the 2015 - 2016 <em><a href="http://www.texastsa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/2015-2016-Spring-Newsletter.pdf" target="_blank">Texas Technology Student Association Vice President</a></em>, founded my high school’s first Girls Who Code Club. Along with this, I traveled to the White House as an <a href="http://www.theesa.com/article/hispanic-heritage-foundation-and-the-entertainment-software-association-announce-2015-loft-video-game-innovation-fellows/" target="_blank"><em>Entertainment Software Association LOFT Innovation Fellow</em></a> and the <em>Intel International Science and Engineering Fair</em> to present SmartGuard: an innovative safety application to tackle my community’s safety issues. While attending Intel ISEF, I was selected as 1 of 6 students internationally to participate in <em><a href="https://student.societyforscience.org/fondazione-bruno-kessler" target="_blank">WebValley Summer School</a></em> - a program based in Italy that conducted research to better treat patients with mental disabilities.
					</p>
					<p>
						Being the only minority present at WebValley Summer School shocked me and only continued to inspire me to strive to be a role model for other Hispanics within the field of computing. Because of this aspiration,  I have been blessed to represent the National Center for Women and Information Technology as a <a href="http://technolochicas.org/2016/02/09/aleida-olvera/" target="_blank"><em>Technolochica</em></a> and a <em><a href="https://www.ncwit.org/news/ncwit-and-bank-america-honor-thirty-five-high-school-women-technology-and-computing-innovators" target="_blank">2015 National Aspirations in Computing Awardee</a></em>, as well the Hispanic Heritage Foundation as a <em><a href="http://hispanicheritage.org/2015-national-youth-awards-feb-4th/" target="_blank">National Hispanic Heritage Youth Awardee for Innovation and Technology</a></em>.
